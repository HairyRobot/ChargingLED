<center><h2>Charging LED Help</h2></center>

Battery <strong>Charging LED</strong> is developed and tested for the Galaxy Nexus, because the phone don't provide any indication 
during charging. It may work on other phones (<font color="#FF0000">NO GUARANTEE</font>).<br/>
Once the app is installed and setup, the phone's LED will blink in different colour during charging with screen off.<br/>

<br/>
Note:<br/>
(i) Due to hardware limitation, the colour the LED emit may looks different.<br/>
(ii) Not all devices support the same number of colours as the Galaxy Nexus. e.g. Some motorola devices only support one colour (white).<br/>
(iii) Not all devices support LED blinking or not-blinking.
<br/>


<h3><u>Setup</u></h3>

There are 3 steps to setting up this app on the Galaxy Nexus for "LED" charging notification.<br/>
<br/>
(1) Enable the "Monitor charging" option in app.<br/>
(2) Enable the "Charging LED" option in app.<br/>
(3) Enable the "Pulse notification light" option in "Settings > Display".<br/>
<br/>
Note:<br/>
(i) Step (3) may not be available/requires on all devices.<br/>
(ii) The app can operate in any combination of "LED", "Notification" and "Sound" charging notification mode.<br/>
(iii) On devices without LED (e.g. Nexus 7) or LED not functioning as desired, the app may still be useful, as it offer sound notification.<br/>
<br/>


<h3><u>General settings</u></h3>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Monitor charging</strong>. Must be enabled for the app to works.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Mode</strong>. Indicate the types of notification that is enabled.<br/><br/>
Note:<br/>
- Enable at least one type, otherwise, Monitor charging will be disabled.<br/>
<br/>

<h3><u>LED settings</u></h3>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Charging LED</strong>. Enable to get battery level LED notification.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Battery level interval</strong>. Goto the define custom battery level interval screen.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Battery level colour</strong>. Goto the define custom colour for each battery level interval screen.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Blink rate</strong>. Goto the define LED blink rate screen.<br/><br/>

<h3><u>Notification settings</u></h3>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Charging notification</strong>. Enable to get battery level notification reported on the system status bar.<br/><br/>

<h3><u>Sound settings</u></h3>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Charging sound</strong>. Enable to get sound notification.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Plugin sound</strong>. Sound played upon charging cable plugged in.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Unplug sound</strong>. Sound played upon charging cable unplugged.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Monitor battery level</strong>. Enable to monitor battery level.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Battery level</strong>. The monitored battery level.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Battery level reached sound</strong>. Sound played upon current battery level is at or above the defined "Battery level". Repeated every 5 minutes.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Enable silent period</strong>. Enable/Disable silent period.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Silent period</strong>. Notification without sound during the defined time period.<br/><br/>


<h3><u>Other settings</u></h3>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Debug mode</strong>. Enable/disable debug mode.<br/><br/>
<strong style="color: #4CC417">Import/Export</strong>. Import/Export the settings from/to storage.<br/><br/>


<h3><u>Using the debug mode</u></h3>

If enabled, a toast message is displayed upon the charging cable is plugged in.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this is to verify the "ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED broadcast" is recognized by the system, and the app is notified.<br/>
For more information, see Testing below.
<br/>


<br/>
<h3><u>Testing</u></h3>

The app is tested on the Galaxy Nexus (GSM), results below:<br/>
<br/>
<u>Works</u>
<ul>
<li><strong>Galaxy Nexus (4.0.4)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Galaxy Nexus (4.1.1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Galaxy Nexus (4.2.1)</strong></li>
</ul>
<u>Don't Works</u>
<ul>
<li><strong>Galaxy Nexus (4.0.1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emulator (4.0.1)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emulator (4.0.3)</strong></li>
</ul>
The reason for the failure is because the system failed to recognize the "ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED broadcast" 
(detect charging cable is plugged in), this is fixed in version 4.0.4.<br/>
<br/>
If this unfortunate event happened with your device, there is nothing I (developer of this app) can do. I had to wait 
until my Nexus is upgraded to 4.0.4 before I can see it working on a real device. Your best bet is to email your device's manufacturer, 
and see if they will release a firmware update.
<br/>


<br/>
<h3><u>Information that may help for your devices</u></h3>
<u><font color="#FFFF00">*** For Nexus 5X users on Android 7 ***</font></u><br/>
<br/>1 - Goto "Settings > System UI Tuner > Other > Power Notification Controls" and turn it on.
<br/>2 - Goto "Settings > Notifications > Charging LED" and change the notification level from Auto (tap on the 'A') to Level 4 (one level higher to the right).
<br/>
<br/>Note:
<br/>- The above options may also exists on different devices, so take a look yourself.

<br/><br/>
<u><font color="#FFFF00">*** For Android 7.1.1 (Lineage OS) ***</font></u><br/>
<br/>Try set notifications to be at least level 4.
<br/>This may also apply to all Android 7. So give it a check.

<br/><br/>
<u><font color="#FFFF00">*** For Samsung Galaxy S3 users ***</font></u><br/>
<br/>The GS3 actually have a built in charging LED indicator option.
<br/>The app maybe having conflict with this option, try disable this first. "Setting > LED indicator > Charging".
<br/>As I don't have access to a GS3, you will have to test it yourself.
<br/>


<br/>
<h3><u>How does this type of app work</u></h3>

I know two methods.<br/>
<br/>
<u><font color="#FFFF00">Method 1</font></u>
<br/>
(a) System detect charging cable is plugged in.<br/>
(b) Start service to blink LED.<br/>
(c) Detect charging cable is unplugged.<br/>
(d) Stop service, stop LED blinking.<br/>
<br/>
<u><font color="#FFFF00">Method 2</font></u>
<br/>
(a) Service (running in background) to monitor charging.<br/>
(b) Start LED blinking, if charging.<br/>
(c) Stop LED blinking, if stop charging.<br/>
<br/>
As method 2 does not rely on system detecting "ACTION_POWER_CONNECTED broadcast" to start a service, it should work on more devices, but it requires a service running constantly in the background.
<br/><br/>
This app uses method 1, because similar apps I found in Play Store uses method 2, and I don't want a service constantly running in the background, also, all I needs is a charging indicator.
<br/><br/>
Given how this app work, if you do rate this app in Play Store, positive or negative, please include your device type (Model number) and os version (Android version).
<br/>
To find this information, goto "Settings > About phone".
<br/>
<br/>Tap <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hk.ChargingLED">here</a> to rate this app in Play Store.
